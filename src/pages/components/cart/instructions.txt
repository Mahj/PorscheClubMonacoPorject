Instructions to import this component in your existing ionic app.

If you don't have an ionic app created, create one, by running the following command on the command console, on the folder you want your app to be created, 
once your app is created locate the pages folder and copy this component (folder) in the page folder:

$ ionic start MyAppName blank

for more info go to the ionic official documentation.


Once you have your app created:
-Install the cordoba plugin and ionic native wrapper:

$ ionic cordova plugin add com.paypal.cordova.mobilesdk
$ npm install --save @ionic-native/paypal

$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-stripe
& npm install @ionic-native/stripe

more info here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/paypal/

-Go to your app.modules.ts and import PayPal, and register it withing the providers array, 

import { PayPal } from '@ionic-native/paypal';
import { Stripe } from '@ionic-native/stripe';
 
 providers: [
    ...
    PayPal,
    Stripe,
	...
	]


Once you have your app created Install the components dependencies (see what is imported on the ts files on this component):

Notes:
For this component to work you need to setup firebase and also import the DatabaseProvider from "/providers/database/database" included on the ionAppFull4Pro project.
Also copy src/config/config.ts from this project (ionAppFull4Pro) to your application, and enter your firebase information.
